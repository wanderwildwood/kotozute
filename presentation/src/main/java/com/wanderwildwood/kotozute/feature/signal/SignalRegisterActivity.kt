/**

 *

 * the person with no other phone to link to — installing Signal for the first time, through
 * this app.
 *
 * The screen leads with what it costs, before anything is typed, because the cost is not
 * recoverable by tapping back: Signal allows one primary device per number, so registering
 * here deregisters that number's Signal wherever else it is and drops its linked devices.
 *
 * Steps are shown and hidden in one screen rather than pushed. The flow genuinely goes
 * backwards — a captcha can be demanded again, a code can be resent or asked for by voice —
 * and a back stack that has to be unwound to allow that is a worse machine than a visibility.
