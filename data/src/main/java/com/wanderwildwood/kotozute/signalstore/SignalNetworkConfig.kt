/**
 * Where to point at Signal.
 *
 * The service layer can open a provisioning socket in two calls, but it will not tell you
 * which servers to open it against: no artifact ships production configuration. Every client
 * carries its own. This one is a port of signal-cli's `LiveConfig.java`, which is GPL-3.0, as
 * is this app -- so it is a licence-compatible copy rather than a reimplementation, and it is
 * marked as one.
 *
 * Ported from signal-cli (AsamK), lib/.../manager/config/LiveConfig.java, GPL-3.0.
 * The trust store beside this file is signal-cli's `whisper.store`, unmodified: Signal pins
 * its own certificate authority, so the system trust store is not enough. It is BKS format,
 * which Android reads; a JKS one would not have loaded at all.
 *
 * These values go stale. Signal rotates enclaves and occasionally moves hosts, and a client
 * carrying old ones simply stops working. Check them against signal-cli whenever it is
 * upgraded rather than assuming they are constants.
