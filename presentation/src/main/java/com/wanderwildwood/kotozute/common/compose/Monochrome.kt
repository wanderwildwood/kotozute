/**
 * The one colour scheme every app of this shop draws in: black ink on white, nothing between.
 *
 * Built with `lightColorScheme()` rather than from MMD's own `eInkColorScheme`. MMD assembles
 * its scheme with the raw `ColorScheme(...)` constructor as it stood when the library was
 * built, so every role Material 3 has added since arrives unset — and an unset colour paints
 * fully transparent instead of failing. `lightColorScheme()` fills every role the resolved
 * Material 3 has, and the values below are MMD's.
 *
 * The container tiers are white on purpose: Mudita's own components draw a text field as white
 * with a rule under it, and a dialog as white inside a black edge. There is no grey here
 * because there is no grey in their palette.
