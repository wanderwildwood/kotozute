/**
 * Signal's protocol state, in its own encrypted database.
 *
 * Separate from Realm on purpose, and the reasoning is in docs/DECISION-protocol-store.md. The
 * short of it: libsignal's store methods are `@CalledFromNative`, so the Rust core re-enters
 * this code synchronously in the middle of a cipher operation, from whichever thread it happens
 * to be on. Realm cannot survive that; SQLite can.
 *
 * Encrypted with the pattern the message database has used since v1.11.2 -- a random key sealed
 * by a keystore key. The limit is the same and worth restating: the keystore key cannot require
 * user authentication, because this database has to open from a boot broadcast and a background
 * socket with nobody present. It protects a lifted file, not code running as this app.
 *
 * ⚠ Losing this key is **not** recoverable the way the message database's is. That one can be
 * discarded and refilled from the bridge. This one holds the device's identity, and losing it
 * means the phone is no longer a device on the account -- the only repair is to link again.
