 * touches the whole rail and belongs in its own change, not this one.)

 * The subtlety that costs a broken thread if missed: a message the user sent from another
 * device arrives as `syncMessage.sent` with the **recipient** in the destination, while
 * everyone else's arrives as `dataMessage` with the **sender** in the envelope source. Both
 * are real messages in the same thread, and they identify the counterpart from opposite ends.
