/**
 * Keeps the websocket alive, and notices when it is only pretending to be.
 *
 * Ported from signal-cli's `SignalWebSocketHealthMonitor` (GPL-3.0, as is this app). It is not
 * in the service library -- the library defines the [HealthMonitor] interface and expects the
 * client to bring one -- so every client writes this, and writing a worse one is easy.
 *
 * The part that earns its keep is not sending the keepalive; it is **waiting for the reply**.
 * A TCP connection to a server that has stopped answering looks open indefinitely, so a socket
 * that only sends is a socket that can be dead for hours while every layer above believes it is
 * connected. So each round does two waits: send at 30s, then check at +20s that something came
 * back, and force a new socket if nothing did.
 *
 * The timer is [AlarmSleepTimer], and it has to be. A thread-sleeping timer is not running at
 * all during Doze, so the 30-second cadence was 30 seconds only while the device was awake --
 * which is to say the check written to notice a dead connection was itself asleep for exactly
 * as long as the connection was dead. Signal uses an alarm-backed timer wherever it has no
 * push to fall back on, which here is always.

         * [elapsedNow] the server's clock now reads that plus the difference. Neither reading
