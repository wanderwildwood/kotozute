 * case-insensitively: the string is typed by a person, and a browser or a keyboard that
 * helpfully capitalises should not lock them out. Older mixed-case tokens still have to match

 * it has to match exactly -- there is no keyboard to forgive. The scheme name is public, so only
 * the token itself is compared without stopping at the first difference.

 * Compares without stopping at the first character that differs.

 * the token the caller got right, and a patient caller on the same network can walk a secret
 * out one character at a time. Over a LAN, through NanoHTTPD, against a token of this length,
 * that attack is not remotely practical -- but a check that is careful in one place and
 * casual in another is worth neither reasoning about nor explaining.
 *
