/**
 * Why a Signal send did not happen, decided where it happened and worded where it is shown.
 *
 * ⚠ **What went wrong and how to say it are two jobs, and they used to be one.** The send path
 * decided the reason and wrote the English sentence in the same breath, so the sentence reached
 * the screen from a layer with no `Context` -- and could only ever be English. The data layer
 * now says which of these happened, with whatever detail the words need, and the screen turns it
 * into the reader's language. Nothing here is meant to be read by a person; the wording lives in
 * the presentation module's `SignalWording`, next to the string resources it reads.
 *
 * A name is carried as it is held, and null where only an id is: the screen words the sentence
 * without a name rather than show hexadecimal.
