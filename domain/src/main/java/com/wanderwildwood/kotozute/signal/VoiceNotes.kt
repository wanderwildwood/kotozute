/**
 * Marking an attachment as a voice note, from the composer all the way to the wire.
 *
 * Signal draws a distinction this app did not: an attachment carries a `voiceNote` flag, and
 * a client that sees it offers a play button where it would otherwise offer a file. Without
 * the flag a recording arrives as `audio/aac`, which every Signal client shows as an
 * attachment to download rather than as something somebody said.
 *
 * ## Why a data-URI parameter rather than a boolean
 *
 * The send path carries an attachment as **one string** -- an RFC 2397 data URI -- and that
 * one string is what flows through the repository, the scheduled-message store and the
 * Desktop Sync relay without any of them knowing what is in it. A parallel boolean would have
 * to be threaded through every one of those, and the first place that forgot to carry it
 * would send a voice note that arrives as a file, silently and only for that route.
 *
 * A media type may take parameters -- that is ordinary RFC 2045, and `data:` inherits it --
 * so the flag travels *inside* the value it describes and cannot be separated from it. A
 * reader that does not know the parameter sees `audio/aac` and is still correct; that is the
 * property worth having.
 *
 * ⚠ The parameter goes **before** `;base64`, which is where a media type's parameters belong.
 * After it, it would be read as part of the encoding token.
