/**
 * Everything the receive path has to tell the rest of the app.
 *
 * These were ten separate lambdas on [SignalReceiver]'s constructor, repeated again on both of
 * [SignalStore]'s entry points and once more where the repository called them. Six of the ten
 * arrived in a single evening of catching up with Signal, and each one cost four edits in four
 * files to add -- which is the kind of friction that makes the next piece of parity look more
 * expensive than it is, and the kind that gets a parameter passed in the wrong order eventually.
 *
 * One interface, every method defaulted to doing nothing. Adding the next thing Signal syncs is
 * now a method here and a handler there.
 *
 * Defaults are deliberate rather than lazy: a caller that does not care about read syncs should
 * not have to write `{}` to say so, and the self-check and the tests construct a receiver
 * without any of this.

     * Says in the conversation that a message arrived and cannot be shown, and why.

     * Three causes, one row, because what the reader needs is the same in each: a marker where
     * a message was, rather than a gap. The [reason] decides only the sentence — and it is an
     * enum rather than a flag because two of the three tell the reader to do *opposite* things,
     * update this app or ask the sender to update theirs, and a boolean that gets those the
     * wrong way round would read perfectly.
     *
     * `DataMessage.requiredProtocolVersion` is the sender stating the minimum understanding a
     * client needs to render the message *correctly*. Below it, the parts this build recognises
     * still parse -- which is precisely the danger. `ProtocolVersion` is
     * `VIEW_ONCE = 2`, `VIEW_ONCE_VIDEO = 3`, `PAYMENTS = 7`, `POLLS = 8`: rendering a
     * view-once photo with an older understanding shows it as an ordinary one, and **the sender
     * believes it disappeared**. That is not a missing feature, it is a broken promise.
     *
     * So the message is not processed at all, and this is said instead. Upstream does the same:
     * `MessageDecryptor:205` returns `Result.UnsupportedDataMessage` rather than continuing, and
     * `MessageContentProcessor:435` inserts an error row and calls
     * `markAsUnsupportedProtocolVersion`.
     *
     * The other two causes are decryption failures rather than content this build refuses:
     * `ProtocolLegacyMessageException` is the *sender's* Signal being too old, and
     * `ProtocolInvalidVersionException` is a ciphertext version this build does not speak.
     * Upstream inserts a row for both — `MessageContentProcessor:421` and `:428`, each with its
     * own marker — and asks for no resend, because a resend would arrive in the same form.
     *
     * Filed under the message's own identity, like [undecryptableGaveUp], so a later build that
     * does understand it replaces the note rather than sitting beside it.
     *
     * @param sender the account id the message was from.
     * @param sentTimestamp the timestamp the sender stamped on it.

     * @param reason which sentence the conversation should carry.
