/**
 * A Signal message, kept deliberately apart from [Message].
 *
 * [Message] is a mirror of the telephony content provider, and a full sync calls
 * SyncRepositoryImpl.removeOldMessages(), which deletes every Message, Conversation,
 * MmsPart and Recipient row before rebuilding them from the provider. Signal rows in
 * those tables would be destroyed by an ordinary re-sync, so they live here instead.
 *
 * The primary key is the bridge's message id -- "<authorUuid>:<timestamp>" -- which is
 * how Signal itself identifies a message. Keying on it means a message can arrive twice
 * (one logical message can produce several notifications, and an imported backup can
 * re-deliver what we already hold) without ever duplicating.
