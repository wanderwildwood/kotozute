/**
 * Small messages this phone owes *about* other messages, and has not managed to send.
 *
 * A delivery receipt is how a sender's message stops saying nothing at all. It is not a
 * setting and it reveals nothing about the reader -- unlike a read receipt -- so it is sent
 * for everything that arrives, without asking.
 *
 * ⚠ **One attempt was the whole of it.** Upstream answers a failed one with
 * `SendDeliveryReceiptJob`: `setLifespan(TimeUnit.DAYS.toMillis(1))`,
 * `setMaxAttempts(Parameters.UNLIMITED)`, queued per recipient. Here it was sent once and any
 * failure was written to the log and forgotten, so a blip between the message landing and the
 * receipt going left the sender looking at a message that had arrived and would never say so.
 *
 * This is only the record of what is owed. It holds no message and no content: both of these
 * name a message the same way -- by who wrote it and the timestamp they stamped on it -- and
 * that is all there is to keep.
 *
 * Two [Kind]s share the table because they are the same fact with a different audience. A
 * **delivery** receipt goes to the person who wrote the message. A **read sync** goes to this
 * account's own other devices, and is the only thing that stops the primary and Desktop
 * notifying for ever about a conversation already read here.
