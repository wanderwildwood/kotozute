/**
 * Registering this phone as a Signal account in its own right.
 *
 * The other way in is [DeviceLinker], which joins an account that already exists on another
 * phone. This is for the person who has no other phone: they are installing Signal for the
 * first time, and this is the only Signal they will have.
 *
 * ⚠ **This takes the number over.** Signal allows exactly one primary device per number, so
 * registering here deregisters Signal wherever else that number is registered and drops every
 * device linked to it. That is not a footnote, it is the decision the caller is making, and
 * the screen that drives this has to say so before the first request goes out.
 *
 * The sequence is the one Signal's own client follows and the one signal-cli follows, because
 * it is simply what the server requires:
 *
 *   1. open a verification session for the number
 *   2. answer whatever the server asks for -- in practice a captcha
 *   3. ask for the code, by SMS or by voice call
 *   4. submit the code
 *   5. register: identity keys, pre keys, and the account's attributes
 *
 * Steps two and three can repeat. The server decides whether a captcha is needed and says so
 * in [RegistrationApiV2.SessionMetadata.requestedInformation]; it is not something this can
 * predict, so the flow asks rather than assumes.
 *
 * There is no push challenge here. That shortcut wants an FCM token, and a Kompakt has no
 * Google Play Services to issue one, so the captcha is the only challenge this can answer.
