/**
 * Takes messages off the socket and decrypts them.
 *
 * The receive half of what the bridge used to do. Structured around one rule, which is
 * signal-cli's and is easy to get backwards:
 *
 * > **Write the envelope down before acknowledging it.**
 *
 * The server deletes a message the moment it is acked and will not send it again. Ack first
 * and crash second and the message is not delayed, it is gone -- while the sender's client
 * shows it delivered. So an envelope is persisted, then acked, and only then decrypted and
 * filed. A crash after the write costs repeated work; it never costs a message.
 *
 * Decryption is deliberately *after* the ack rather than before. It is the step most likely to
 * fail -- an unknown session, a changed identity, a message from a device we have no session
 * with -- and holding the queue open behind a message that cannot be decrypted would stop
 * every message behind it.

     *
     * - **Only from device 1.** No other linked device may change this account's identity.
     * - **Newer than the last one applied.** The server redelivers, and an old change arriving
     *   late would replace live key material with superseded key material. That is what the
     *   watermark in the account table is for.
     * - **All fields present and sane**, because a half-applied change leaves this device
     *   holding a PNI whose identity key it does not have.
     *
